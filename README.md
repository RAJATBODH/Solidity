Create a Token

Overview

This project focuses on creating a simple token on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. The token will have basic functionalities, including storing token details, minting new tokens, and burning existing tokens. This exercise aims to provide a fundamental understanding of how tokens operate on blockchain platforms.

Description

In this project, you will create a smart contract named MyToken using Solidity version 0.8.18. The contract will include public variables to store token details such as name, abbreviation, and total supply. It will also use a mapping to track token balances for different addresses. The contract will feature:

Mint Function: Increases the total supply and the balance of a given address.
Burn Function: Decreases the total supply and the balance of a given address, ensuring the address has a sufficient balance before burning.

Getting Started

Installing:

Visit the Remix IDE website.
No installation is required as Remix is an online IDE.
Executing the Program:

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity >=0.6.12 <0.9.0;

contract Token {

    // public variables here
    string public tokenName = "Rajat Bodh";
    string public tokenAbbrv = "Raj";
    uint public totalSupply = 0;
    // mapping variable here
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    // mint function
    function mint(address tokenAddress, uint value) public {
        totalSupply += value;
        balances[tokenAddress] += value;
    }
    // burn function
    function burn(address tokenAddress, uint value) public {
        if(balances[tokenAddress] >= value) {
            totalSupply -= value;
            balances[tokenAddress] -= value;
        }
    }
}

Open Remix IDE in your web browser.
Create a new file and name it MyToken.sol.
Compile the contract by selecting the "Solidity Compiler" tab and clicking "Compile MyToken.sol".
Deploy the contract by navigating to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab, selecting your contract, and clicking "Deploy".
Interact with your deployed contract using the provided interface to call functions like 'tokenName', 'tokenAbbr', 'totalSupply', 'mint', and 'burn'.

Help
For common issues:

Ensure a stable internet connection while using Remix IDE.
Verify the Solidity version in Remix is set to 0.8.18.
If errors occur during compilation or deployment, double-check the syntax and version compatibility.
For further assistance, refer to the Remix documentation or the help command within Remix IDE.
